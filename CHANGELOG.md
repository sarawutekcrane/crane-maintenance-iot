# Changelog

## Web/API Phase 1 — Foundation, Local Development Stack, API Contracts, Repository Abstraction, Thai UI Shell

- Backend: FastAPI application (`backend/`) with `/api/v1/health` and
  `/api/v1/readiness`, a shared error envelope, request-id middleware,
  a development request/user context (`DEV_AUTH_MODE`), and OpenAPI docs.
- Repository abstraction (`Repository` interface) with a working
  `MockRepository` (fully offline) and a `GoogleSheetsRepository` base
  adapter (connectivity/config check only; no domain tables yet).
- `StorageProvider` abstraction with a working `LocalFileStorageProvider`.
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite app (`frontend/`) with a Thai UI
  shell (nav, loading/empty/error/permission-denied states, confirm
  dialog, status badge, responsive layout) and a System Status page that
  calls the backend through the `/api` dev proxy.
- Backend tests (pytest, 9 tests) and frontend tests (Vitest + Testing
  Library, 3 test files) — both run fully offline.
- `docs/architecture/API_CONVENTIONS.md` documents the frozen API
  version/error-envelope/pagination/ID/date-time conventions and the
  Google Sheets -> PostgreSQL swap boundary.
- `scripts/` for local backend/frontend/test startup.

See `docs/phase-results/web-phase-01-result.md` for the full Phase Result
Report.
